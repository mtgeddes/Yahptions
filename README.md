# Yahptions!
Find food by process of elimination
* Based on the popular game Yahtzee, now you can find a place to eat by rolling for restaurants.

* Everytime you find a potential place you would like to eat at, click that card to hold it as a "maybe".

* Once you have locked-in 5 "maybes", start eliminating your least favorites.

* You'll be left with just 1 restaurant that you should be confident you'll enjoy!
